 * button for the module implementing the hook. That's defined in the

 * how a node type should behave for Project*, those are also defined
 * here. The spot where this hook is invoked will automatically populate the
 * #states value for these form elements to only appear if the behavior
 * setting radio for this module is selected. Since this is all ultimately
 * impacting a node_type edit form, the keys of these form elements will be
 * used to automatically call variable_set() with the node type machine name
 * appended as a suffix.
 *
 * @param array $form
 *   The node type edit form. Of particular interest, the machine name for the
 *   node type being edited lives in $form['#node_type']->type and you need
 *   that for properly defining the #default_value on any settings you provide.
 *
 * @return array
 *   An array of form elements to use for project-specific settings for the
 *   given node type. The special key '#behavior_label' is required to ensure
 *   we have a sane human-readable label on the project behavior radio button
 *   for the implementing module.
